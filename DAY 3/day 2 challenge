# 🌟 SQLWithIDC – Day 3 Challenge

## 🧩 Challenge Question

Retrieve the top 5 weeks with the highest patient refusals across all services, showing **week**, **service**, **patients_refused**, and **patients_request**.
Sort by **patients_refused** in descending order.

## 💻 SQL Query
SELECT week, service, patients_refused, patients_request FROM services_weekly ORDER BY patients_refused DESC LIMIT 5;

🧠 **Explanation**
This query retrieves the **top 5 records** from the `services_weekly` table where patient refusals are the highest.

* `ORDER BY patients_refused DESC` sorts data by refusal count from high to low.
* `LIMIT 5` restricts results to the top 5.
* It helps identify which weeks and services faced maximum refusals.

## 🧩 Practical Questions

**1️⃣ List all patients sorted by age in descending order.**
SELECT * FROM patients ORDER BY age DESC;

**2️⃣ Show all services_weekly data sorted by week number ascending and patients_request descending.**
SELECT * FROM services_weekly ORDER BY week ASC, patients_request DESC;

**3️⃣ Display staff members sorted alphabetically by their names.**
SELECT * FROM staff ORDER BY staff_name ASC;
