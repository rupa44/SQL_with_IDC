# 🌟 SQLWithIDC – Day 6 Challenge

## 🧩 **Challenge Question**
For each hospital service, calculate the total number of patients admitted, total patients refused, and the admission rate (percentage of requests that were admitted).
Order by admission rate descending

## 💻 **SQL Query**
SELECT service, SUM(patients_admitted) AS Total_patients_admitted, SUM(patients_refused) AS Total_patients_refused, (SUM(patients_admitted) * 100 / SUM(patients_request)) 
AS Admission_rate FROM services_weekly GROUP BY service ORDER BY Admission_rate DESC;

🧠 **Explanation**
* `SUM(patients_admitted)` → Calculates total admitted patients for each service.
* `SUM(patients_refused)` → Calculates total refused patients.
* `SUM(patients_request)` → Gives total requests for each service.
* `(SUM(patients_admitted) * 100 / SUM(patients_request))` → Calculates **admission rate (%)**.
* `ORDER BY Admission_rate DESC` → Sorts services by highest admission rate.

##  **Practical Questions**

**1️⃣ Count the number of patients by each service.**
SELECT service, COUNT(*) AS total_patients FROM patients GROUP BY service;

**2️⃣ Calculate the average age of patients grouped by service.**
SELECT service, AVG(age) AS average_age FROM patients GROUP BY service ORDER BY service;

**3️⃣ Find the total number of staff members per role.**
SELECT role, COUNT(*) AS total_staff FROM staff GROUP BY role;
