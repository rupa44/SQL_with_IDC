# 🌟 SQLWithIDC – Day 4 Challenge

## 🧩 Challenge Question

Find the **3rd to 7th highest patient satisfaction scores** from the `patients` table, showing **patient_id**, **name**, **service**, and **satisfaction**.
Display only these 5 records.

## 💻 SQL Query
SELECT patient_id, name, service, satisfaction  FROM patients ORDER BY satisfaction DESC LIMIT 5 OFFSET 2;

🧠 **Explanation**
This query retrieves the **3rd to 7th highest satisfaction scores** from the `patients` table.
* `ORDER BY satisfaction DESC` sorts patients by their satisfaction in descending order.
* `OFFSET 2` skips the top 2 highest scores.
* `LIMIT 5` then fetches the next 5 results (3rd–7th).

## 🧩 Practical Questions
**1️⃣ Display the first 5 patients from the patients table.**
SELECT patient_id, name, service, satisfaction FROM patients LIMIT 5;

**2️⃣ Show patients 11–20 from the patients table.**
SELECT patient_id, name, service, satisfaction FROM patients LIMIT 10 OFFSET 10;

**3️⃣ Get the 10 most recent patient admissions based on arrival_date.**
SELECT patient_id, name, service, arrival_date FROM patients ORDER BY arrival_date DESC LIMIT 10;
