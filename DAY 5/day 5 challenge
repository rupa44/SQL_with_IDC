# 🌟 SQLWithIDC – Day 5 Challenge

## 🧩 Challenge Question

Calculate the **total number of patients admitted**, **total patients refused**, and the **average patient satisfaction** across all services and weeks.
Round the average satisfaction to **2 decimal places**.

## 💻 SQL Query
SELECT SUM(patients_admitted) AS total_patients_admitted,SUM(patients_refused) AS total_patients_refused,ROUND(AVG(patient_satisfaction), 2) AS avg_patient_satisfaction
FROM services_weekly;

🧠 **Explanation**
* `SUM(patients_admitted)` → Adds all admitted patients.
* `SUM(patients_refused)` → Adds all refused patients.
* `AVG(patient_satisfaction)` → Calculates the mean satisfaction across all weeks and services.
* `ROUND(..., 2)` → Rounds the average to 2 decimal places.

## 🧩 Practical Questions

**1️⃣ Count the total number of patients in the hospital.**
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_patients FROM patients;

**2️⃣ Calculate the average satisfaction score of all patients.**
SELECT AVG(satisfaction) AS avg_satisfaction_score FROM patients;

**3️⃣ Find the minimum and maximum age of patients.**
SELECT MIN(age) AS min_age, MAX(age) AS max_age FROM patients;
