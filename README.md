## 🧩 **Challenge Overview**

* **Duration:** 21 Days
* **Focus:** Core to advanced SQL — including queries, joins, subqueries, window functions, CTEs, and query optimization..
* **Structure:** Each day covers one key concept with practical problems and datasets.

Each day contains a question, SQL query, and short explanation — for example:

* **Day 1:** Basic filtering and selection
* **Day 2:** Conditional queries (`WHERE`, `AND`, `OR`)
* **Day 3:** Sorting, ordering, and practical tasks
* *(...and so on till Day 21!)*
