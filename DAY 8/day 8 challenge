# 🌟 SQLWithIDC – Day 8 Challenge

## 🧩 **Challenge Question**
Create a patient summary that shows patient_id, full name in uppercase, service in lowercase, age category
(if age >= 65 then 'Senior', if age >= 18 then 'Adult', else 'Minor'), and name length. 
Only show patients whose name length is greater than 10 characters.

## 💻 **SQL Query**
SELECT patient_id,UPPER(name) AS Full_Name,LOWER(service) AS Service_Name,CASE WHEN age >= 65 THEN 'Senior'WHEN age >= 18 THEN 'Adult'
ELSE 'Minor'END AS Age_Category,LENGTH(name) AS Name_Length FROM patients WHERE LENGTH(name) > 10;

🧠 **Explanation**
* `UPPER(name)` → Converts each patient’s name to uppercase.
* `LOWER(service)` → Converts the service name to lowercase.
* `CASE` → Categorizes patients into **Senior**, **Adult**, or **Minor** based on age.
* `LENGTH(name)` → Finds the number of characters in each name.
* `WHERE LENGTH(name) > 10` → Filters only those with long names.

## **Practical Questions**
**1️⃣ Convert all patient names to uppercase.**
SELECT patient_id,UPPER(name) AS Full_Name FROM patients;
  
**2️⃣ Find the length of each staff member's name.**
SELECT staff_id,staff_name,LENGTH(staff_name) AS Name_Length FROM staff;

**3️⃣ Concatenate staff_id and staff_name with a hyphen (-) separator.**
SELECT staff_id,staff_name,CONCAT(staff_id, '-', staff_name) AS Staff_Details FROM staff;
