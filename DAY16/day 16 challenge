# 🌟 **SQLWithIDC – Day 16 Challenge**

## 🧩 **Challenge Question**

Find all patients who were admitted to services that had at least one week where patients were refused AND
the average patient satisfaction for that service was below the overall hospital average satisfaction.
Show patient_id, name, service, and their personal satisfaction score.
  
## 💻 **SQL Query**
SELECT p.patient_id, p.name, p.service, p.satisfaction FROM patients p
WHERE p.service IN (SELECT sw.service FROM services_weekly sw
WHERE sw.service IN (SELECT service FROM services_weekly WHERE patients_refused > 0)
GROUP BY sw.service HAVING AVG(sw.patient_satisfaction) < (SELECT AVG(patient_satisfaction) FROM services_weekly));

--Practice questions
--1. Patients who are in services with above-average staff count
SELECT p.patient_id, p.name, p.service FROM patients p WHERE p.service IN (
SELECT service FROM staff GROUP BY service HAVING COUNT(*) > (SELECT AVG(staff_count)FROM (
SELECT service, COUNT(*) AS staff_count FROM staff GROUP BY service) AS sc));*/

--2. Staff who work in services that had ANY week with patient satisfaction < 70
SELECT s.staff_id, s.staff_name, s.service FROM staff s WHERE s.service IN (
SELECT DISTINCT service FROM services_weekly WHERE patient_satisfaction < 70);

--3. Patients from services where total admitted patients exceed 1000
SELECT p.patient_id, p.name, p.service FROM patients p WHERE p.service IN (
SELECT service FROM services_weekly GROUP BY service HAVING SUM(patients_admitted) > 1000);
