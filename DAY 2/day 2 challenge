# 🌟 SQLWithIDC – Day 2 Challenge

## 🧩 Question

Find all patients admitted to 'Surgery' service with a satisfaction score below 70, showing their patient_id, name, age, and satisfaction score.

## 💻 SQL Query

SELECT patient_id, name, age, satisfaction FROM patients WHERE service = 'surgery'
AND satisfaction < 70;

🧠 **Explanation**
This query selects all patients from the `patients` table who are admitted under the **'Surgery'** service and have a **satisfaction score less than 70**.
It displays their **patient_id**, **name**, **age**, and **satisfaction** fields, helping identify patients with lower satisfaction levels in the Surgery department.
