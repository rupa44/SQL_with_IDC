# 🌟 SQLWithIDC – Day 12 Challenge

## 🧩 **Challenge Question**
Analyze the event impact by comparing weeks with events vs weeks without events.
Show: event status ('With Event' or 'No Event'), count of weeks, average patient satisfaction, and average staff morale.
Order by average patient satisfaction descending.
  
## 💻 **SQL Query**
SELECT CASE WHEN event IS NULL OR event = 'none' THEN 'No Event' ELSE 'With Event'
END AS event_status,
COUNT(*) AS week_count,
ROUND(AVG(patient_satisfaction), 2) AS avg_patient_satisfaction,
ROUND(AVG(staff_morale), 2) AS avg_staff_morale
FROM services_weekly GROUP BY event_status ORDER BY avg_patient_satisfaction DESC;

## 🧠 **Explanation**
* `CASE WHEN event IS NULL OR event = 'none'` → Categorizes rows without events.
* `COUNT(*)` → Counts how many weeks fall under each event status.
* `AVG(patient_satisfaction)` & `AVG(staff_morale)` → Measures impact on satisfaction and morale.
* `GROUP BY event_status` → Groups data into “With Event” vs “No Event”.
* `ORDER BY avg_patient_satisfaction DESC` → Shows which group performs better.

## **Practice Questions**

1️⃣ Find all weeks in services_weekly where no special event occurred.
SELECT week FROM services_weekly WHERE event IS NULL OR event = '' OR event = 'none';

2️⃣ Count how many records have null or empty event values.
SELECT COUNT(*) AS no_event_count FROM services_weekly WHERE event IS NULL OR event = '';

3️⃣ List all services that had at least one week with a special event.
SELECT DISTINCT service FROM services_weekly WHERE event NOT IN ('none', '');
