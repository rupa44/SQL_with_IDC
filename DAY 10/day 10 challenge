# 🌟 SQLWithIDC – Day 10 Challenge

## 🧩 **Challenge Question**

Create a service performance report showing service name, total patients admitted, and a performance category based on the following:
'Excellent' if avg satisfaction >= 85, 'Good' if >= 75, 'Fair' if >= 65, otherwise 'Needs Improvement'. Order by average satisfaction descending.

## 💻 **SQL Query**
SELECT service,SUM(patients_admitted) AS total_patients_admitted,ROUND(AVG(patient_satisfaction), 2) AS avg_satisfaction,
CASE WHEN AVG(patient_satisfaction) >= 85 THEN 'Excellent' WHEN AVG(patient_satisfaction) >= 75 THEN 'Good'
WHEN AVG(patient_satisfaction) >= 65 THEN 'Fair' ELSE 'Needs Improvement' END AS performance_category
FROM services_weekly GROUP BY service ORDER BY avg_satisfaction DESC;

## 🧠 **Explanation**

* `SUM(patients_admitted)` → Calculates the total number of patients admitted per service.
* `AVG(patient_satisfaction)` → Finds the average satisfaction score for each service.
* `ROUND(..., 2)` → Rounds the average satisfaction to two decimal places.
* `CASE` → Categorizes services based on satisfaction level.
* `ORDER BY avg_satisfaction DESC` → Displays services from highest to lowest satisfaction.

## **Practice Questions**

**1️⃣ Categorise patients as 'High', 'Medium', or 'Low' satisfaction based on their scores.**
SELECT patient_id,name,satisfaction,CASE 
WHEN satisfaction >= 80 THEN 'High'
WHEN satisfaction >= 60 THEN 'Medium'
ELSE 'Low' END AS satisfaction_level FROM patients;

**2️⃣ Label staff roles as 'Medical' or 'Support' based on role type.**
SELECT staff_id,staff_name,role,CASE WHEN role IN ('Doctor', 'Nurse') THEN 'Medical' ELSE 'Support'
END AS role_category FROM staff;

**3️⃣ Create age groups for patients (0-18, 19-40, 41-65, 65+).**
SELECT patient_id,name,age,CASE
WHEN age BETWEEN 0 AND 18 THEN '0-18  Pediatric'
WHEN age BETWEEN 19 AND 40 THEN '19-40  Adult'
WHEN age BETWEEN 41 AND 65 THEN '41-65  Middle-aged'
ELSE '65+  Senior' END AS age_group FROM patients;
