# 🌟 SQLWithIDC – Day 11 Challenge

## 🧩 **Challenge Question**
Find all unique combinations of service and event type from the services_weekly table where events are not null or none,
along with the count of occurrences for each combination. Order by count descending.

## 💻 **SQL Query**
SELECT service,event,COUNT(*) AS total_count FROM services_weekly
WHERE event IS NOT NULL AND NOT (event = 'none') GROUP BY service, event
ORDER BY total_count DESC;

## 🧠 **Explanation**
* `event IS NOT NULL` → Removes rows where event is missing.
* `NOT (event = 'none')` → Excludes dummy/invalid event entries.
* `COUNT(*)` → Counts how many times each service–event pair appears.
* `GROUP BY service, event` → Groups results by both service and event to get unique combinations.
* `ORDER BY total_count DESC` → Shows the most frequent combinations first.

## **Practice Questions**
**1️⃣ List all unique services in the patients table.**
SELECT DISTINCT service FROM patients;

**2️⃣ Find all unique staff roles in the hospital.**
SELECT DISTINCT role FROM staff;

**3️⃣ Get distinct months from the services_weekly table.**
SELECT DISTINCT month FROM services_weekly ORDER BY month;
